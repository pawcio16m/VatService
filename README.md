# VAT calculator

This simple application allows to add products with price and vat to calculate vat value.

Instruction:
1. Add product with price and vat value (e.g. 5%/8%/23%)
2. Vat will be calculated and show in VAT column
3. Total present total vat for all products


*Requirements for this application was very low. I'm not sure if this is expected solution.
Other implementation could be that we have some defined products with defined VAT according to law,
and we can select from this products and add them to cart and then calculate VAT.
Anyway we need to have defined some kind of map like product - vat.
It will be time consuming to define all products from the whole world to create some kind of map,
so I decided to allow user to provide product with VAT in % and then calculate how much VAT needs to be paid.
